Currently, I am working on drupal.
I want to add a functionality in the website so that I can debug the twig templates in the website.
This is done through 
1.Copy the example.services.yml to services.yml.
If services.yml is there, create a new file named services.yml and copy and paste the contents of the example.services.yml.
2.Change the twig.config: section
debug:true  
auto_reload:true
