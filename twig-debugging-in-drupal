Currently, I am working on drupal.
I want to add a functionality in the website so that I can debug the twig templates in the website.
First, make sure you're working in development mode by switching the site to use the development services file.
To do this,
I modified the sites/defsult/settings.php file for this.
Added this line
Can replace the original one too  
//centroxy
$settings['container_yamls'][] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/sites/development.services.yml';
When DRUPAL_ROOT gave me error,
Added this line at the top of the settings.php file.
//centroxy
if (!defined('DRUPAL_ROOT')) {
  define('DRUPAL_ROOT', dirname(__DIR__, 2));
}
Now,to enable twig debugging..
Open sites/default/development.services.yml and add or modify the following lines under the twig.config section:
3rd step -> Go to Configuration -> Development -> Performance and click Clear all caches.
This did not work met with an error.
